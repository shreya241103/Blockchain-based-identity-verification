# Identity Verification Smart Contract

## Introduction
This Solidity smart contract, `IdentityVerification`, facilitates the verification of user identities and registration of third-party applications for accessing user data. It ensures secure verification through cryptographic signatures and provides a mechanism for registering and verifying third-party apps.

## Features
- User identity registration with details such as username, phone number, email, and Aadhar number.
- Third-party application registration with company name, email, and phone number.
- Cryptographic signature verification for user and app registration.
- Admin privileges for verifying third-party applications and managing user data validation.

## Contract Structure
The contract consists of two main components:
1. **IdentityVerification**: Manages user identity registration and third-party app registration.
2. **DataValidator**: Validates user data during registration.

## Usage
### Identity Verification
1. `registerIdentity`: Allows users to register their identity with the contract by providing username, phone number, email, Aadhar number, and cryptographic signature (v, r, s).
   - Signature Verification: Users must generate a cryptographic signature using their private key and include it along with v, r, and s components to ensure data integrity and authentication.

2. `requestUserData`: Enables verified third-party apps to request user data.

### Third-Party App Registration
1. `registerThirdPartyApp`: Allows third-party apps to register with the contract by providing company name, email, phone number, and cryptographic signature (v, r, s).
   - Signature Verification: Third-party apps must generate a cryptographic signature using their private key and include it along with v, r, and s components to ensure data integrity and authentication.

2. `verifyThirdPartyApp`: Allows the admin to verify registered third-party apps.

### Data Validation
The `DataValidator` contract validates user data during registration and provides an initial dataset of users for testing purposes.
